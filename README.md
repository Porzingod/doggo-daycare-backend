# Doggo Daycare
A fun little javascript application.

Make sure to love and take care of your doggo!

This applicatoin was built using vanilla JS and a Ruby on Rails API backend. Being my project partner and I's first JS project, we wanted to build something interactive and fun. The result was a virtual doggo. Thank you for checking out the video and/or project!
